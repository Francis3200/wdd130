        <img src="images/republica-dominicana.webp" alt="white building in green trees" width="500">
        <p> The Dominican Republic is a vibrant and diverse nation located in the heart of the
            Caribbean,
            occupying two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola. The country is a paradise of
            geographical contrasts,
            ranging from expansive white-sand beaches fringed by crystal-clear waters, such as those
            of Punta Cana
            and Bahía de las Águilas, to majestic mountains, including Pico Duarte, the highest peak
            in the Antilles.
            Its rich culture is a colorful blend of European, African, and Taíno influences, evident
            in its music, cuisine,
            and the warmth of its people. The birthplace of merengue and bachata, the country exudes
            joy and hospitality,
            with tourism being one of its main sources of income, along with free trade zones,
            remittances, and mining.
            Furthermore, it boasts a rich history, home to the Colonial City of Santo Domingo,
            recognized as the first
            permanent European settlement in the Americas and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
